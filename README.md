FIPS
==============

Project Overview
----------------

This repository is part of the project "An Extensible Framework for Indoor Positioning on Mobile Devices", which is the master thesis that I did in 2011-2012 at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to achieve my "Master in Applied Computer Science". My promotor for this master thesis was [Prof. Dr. Beat Signer](http://www.beatsigner.com/). The thesis document can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0xehv5qodxh3id/Van%20Rossem%20-%202012%20-%20A%20FrameWork%20for%20Indoor%20Positioning%20on%20Mobile%20Devices.pdf).

The entire project is divided into several repositories:

* [FIPS-Datastore](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Datastore)
* [FIPS-Server](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Server)
* [FIPS-Tool](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Tool)
* [FIPS-Android-Offline](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Android-Offline)
* [FIPS-Android-Online](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Android-Online)

FIPS Sample Data
----------------

This repository contains all the fingerprint samples that were collected during the project in the hope that they can be helpful to test the framework or can be used in other other projects.

Only the data in `new_format` is relevant to test the current framework, but the other formats could still be used in other projects (or transformed to the new fomat).

The fingerprinting was done at the Brussels South railway station using the [FIPS-Android-Offline](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Android-Offline) application, running on a Samsung Galaxy S II device.

 The data in `new_format` was captured at maps full, medium and small. All other older data was measured on the full map.
